            				<p class="paraAbout">LingualBox is an online English language school offering 1:1 Live English classes online to students all over the world. <br/><br/>
            					Our founder Atsuhiro Teshima had been struggling with learning to speak English in Japan because of the lack of opportunities and teaching style of high school in Japan which too lean to Grammar and Reading.<br/><br/> 
            					On his backpacking trip in Southeast Asia, he went through many sour experiences because of the lacking of speaking skill. 
            					After the trip, he started learning at an online English language school which Filipino tutors are teaching. 
            					Although it helped him to become comfortable with speaking English, most schools he tried had no curriculum fit to learner's levels and it makes him to realise it would not work well for most learners. <br/><br/>
            					LingualBox was started for solving this problem. Our goal is to offer more effective way to learn English by offering effective curriculums fit to each student's needs through technology and more human interactive way. <br/><br/>
            					Alongside running the website, we noticed that most schools are teaching English only to Asian countries especially China, Japan and South Korea. 
            					We start taking the opportunity to offering the classes to students globally. <br/><br/>
            					Currently LingualBox is offering the service in 6 languages and students from more than 50 countries are learning with us. </p>
